If you are interested in buying the GRPG framework to run your own RPG, I encourage you to look at the running version of the game that can be found here. Just create an account from the the menu there to your left, login, and see what GRPG is capable of. Remember that everything about GRPG is customizable, as demonstrated by sites such as www.lunarbattle.com which features a Space Age version, and orion.cs.cx which is a mafia version translated in french. <br><br>If after checking out GRPG, you find that it was what you like, e-mail me at myneocorp@gmail.com and we can get you all set up. <br><br>If after checking out GRPG, you like what you see but would like to see for sure what you can edit and customize etc., email me at myneocorp@gmail.com and let me know that you would like to try out a trial version. Thanks for your interest!
